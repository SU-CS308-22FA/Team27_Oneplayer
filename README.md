# ONE PLAYER

One Player is a football website where Managers can share information and photos about their players, and fans can easily access all football-related information. With the managers login, managers can share the latest news and photos about the football players they represent on this page for the fans. Fans can comment and like these posts. In addition, fans can find current matches, match results, analyzes of players on this page and even compare two players through analysis. Thus, there is always an active bond between football, football player, manager, clubs and fans.

Working by separating it into modules helps to handle the changes more easily, to solve the problem in a way that does not affect the whole code, and to export the necessary information.
